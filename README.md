# Amazon_Clone
This is a side project where the purpose is to build out a marketplace that looks like Amazon using ReactJS for the FrontEnd and Django for the Backend.


# Getting started with this React X Django Application

### Clone the repository into a directory on your local machine

I have not configured this project for production, for the time being just view using the development server

### Open two instances of the terminal

For the first instance of the terminal, you must be in the root directory of the project which holds all of the files that have been cloned(Ex. Amazon_Clone).
Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" (Make sure you have pip installed), then run "python manage.py runserver"

For the second instance of the terminal, change directories from the root directory into the "frontendreact" directory. 
Run the command "npm run dev"

### Run the development server
Now in your browser, open "127.0.0.1:8000" and view the project!
